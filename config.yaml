# Akita Geofence Notifier Configuration

# --- Meshtastic Settings ---
# Your private channel Pre-Shared Key (PSK) as a HEX string.
# Use "" or "changeme" for the primary channel (usually channel 0).
# Generate using: meshtastic --genpsk
private_channel_psk: "" # Example: "1PG7z..." (replace with actual hex key if using private channel 1)

# --- GPS Settings ---
# Serial port where your GPS module is connected
# Linux examples: /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyACM0
# Windows examples: COM3, COM4
# Set to "" or null to disable direct serial GPS reading.
gps_serial_port: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
# Baud rate for the serial GPS module
gps_baud_rate: 9600

# --- Timing Intervals (seconds) ---
# How often to attempt reading and sending GPS location to the mesh
gps_update_interval: 60
# How often to check node distances, geofences, and stationary status
check_interval: 10
# Time threshold for detecting a stationary node
stationary_time_threshold: 300 # 5 minutes
# Distance threshold (km) to consider a node stationary (within the time threshold)
stationary_distance_threshold: 0.05 # 50 meters

# --- Geofences ---
# Define named circular geofences.
# Notifications are triggered when *any* node enters or exits *any* of these fences.
geofences:
  - name: "Home Base"
    latitude: 42.8864 # Example: Port Colborne City Hall approx lat
    longitude: -79.2496 # Example: Port Colborne City Hall approx lon
    radius_km: 0.5 # 500 meters radius
  - name: "Canal Lock 8"
    latitude: 42.8796
    longitude: -79.2427
    radius_km: 0.2 # 200 meters radius
# Add more geofences as needed following the same structure

# --- Web Interface ---
web_host: "0.0.0.0" # Host for the web UI (0.0.0.0 makes it accessible on the network)
web_port: 5000      # Port for the web UI

# --- LED Feedback (Experimental) ---
# Enable LED proximity feedback (True/False). Requires hardware/firmware support
# and correct configuration in core/meshtastic_utils.py -> set_device_led function.
enable_led_feedback: false
# LED flashes faster as the *closest* node gets nearer.
# Max flash frequency (Hz) when very close. Set 0 to disable flashing.
led_max_frequency_hz: 2.0 # Flashes twice per second when close
# Distance (km) at which max frequency is reached.
led_min_distance_km: 0.1 # 100 meters

# --- Other ---
# Earth's approximate radius in kilometers for distance calculations
geodetic_radius_km: 6371.0
